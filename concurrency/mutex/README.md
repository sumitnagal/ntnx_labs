# Deployment Lab

## <img src="../../../assets/lab.png" width="auto" height="32"/> Your Mission...

> In this lab, we are going to fetch books and count words concurrently.
> Each worker will take a book and a word to report on. Once
> completed the worker will update a map of books and report its word count.
> Workers will need to write to a shared book counter location ðŸ˜œ

1. In your cloned labs repo, navigate to concurrency/mutex directory.
2. Implement a worker that takes a book url and a word and computes the word count for that book.
3. If a worker successfully got a book from the external repo and counted its word, it updates the
   global book counter.
4. If a worker fails, it must make sure to zero out the book counter for that book and word
5. When completed, print out a summary of all books scanned including the word list counts for each of
   the books.
6. Make sure no data races exist in your program!


## Commands
