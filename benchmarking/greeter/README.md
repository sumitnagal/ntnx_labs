> Congratulations! You've just got a new gig working at Google!!
> Your PM says we have to speed up the initial greeting page load that's
> being hit by billions of users! The page greets the users with
> a user name and age.

* Using Benchmark tests implement a second version of the greeter and compare with this initial version.
* Make sure your new implementation works the same as the old one ie your tests pass for both implementations!
* HINT! Another way to concatenate strings is by using the + operator or use strings.Builder
* What are your findings?
